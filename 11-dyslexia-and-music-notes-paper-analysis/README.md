## Overview
Dyslexia is a learning disorder that affects approximately 5-10% of children worldwide. 
It is characterized by difficulties with reading fluency and phonological processing, which can significantly impact academic and social development. 
Music interventions have been proposed as a potential treatment for dyslexia, 
as they can target some of the same cognitive processes that are impaired in dyslexia, such as phonological awareness and auditory memory.

## Paper Summery
David Gómez Oropeza et al.'s (2021) paper focuses on the effects of different music notation designs on the readability 
of music for children with dyslexia. They compare the traditional music notation system to a newly designed notation system 
that is based on the Gestalt laws of perception. They find that the newly designed notation system is more readable for children with dyslexia.


This paper investigates the relationship between the design of written music and the number of mistakes dyslexic and non-dyslexic 
children make in reading music. The study used a public dataset of musical notation examples and a group of children with and without 
dyslexia to evaluate the readability of different music notation designs.

## Findings
The study found that children with dyslexia made significantly more mistakes than non-dyslexic children when reading music with traditional notation. 
However, children with dyslexia made fewer mistakes when reading music with a newly designed notation system that was based on the Gestalt laws of perception.

The authors of the paper conclude that the design of written music can have a significant impact on the readability of music for children with dyslexia. 
They suggest that music notation systems should be designed to be more intuitive and easier to learn for all children, including those with dyslexia.

  - Children with dyslexia found a newly designed music notation system to be more readable than traditional music notation.
  - The newly designed notation system was based on the Gestalt principles of perception.
  - The Gestalt principles of perception include principles of proximity, similarity, and closure.
  - The newly designed notation system used larger note sizes, more note spacing, and a different font type than traditional music notation.
