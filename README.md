 some introductory DAX (Data Analytics Expressions), and touch on troubleshooting and optimization.

**2. Creating Visualizations with Power BI**

Covers: a variety of common and more advanced data visualizations, how to design reports around these data visuals in order to focus user attention on key insights, 
help users navigate different features and report pages and enable accessibility options for diverse audiences, how to use filters and slicers, and 
deliver a couple of advanced features capable of elevating how users navigate and engage with visuals and the report itself.


**3. Advanced Data Analysis**

Covers: an introduction to data analysis looking at different terms and techniques 
such as descriptive and inferential statistics, histograms, linear regression and an introduction to the concepts of correlation and probability. 
After taking the introductory lessons on data analytics, the course then moves to M, the language of Power Query, 
and learning to build custom formulas as part of the data transformation process. The overarching goal of the course is to help students 
become effective at the process of retrieving, analyzing and visualizing data in order to answer questions and draw conclusions.
